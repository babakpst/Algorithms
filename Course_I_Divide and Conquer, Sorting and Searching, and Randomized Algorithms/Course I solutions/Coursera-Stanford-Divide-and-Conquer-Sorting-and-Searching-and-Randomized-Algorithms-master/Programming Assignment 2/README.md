# Goal
Your task is to compute the number of inversions in the file given, where the ith row of the file indicates the ith entry of an array.
# File Description
- `.txt` files is data file.
  - `IntegerArray.txt` consists of 100,000 integers between 1 and 100,000 (inclusive) in some order, with no integer repeated..
- `.py` file is the solution of Week 2 program assignment
  - `IntegerArray.py`
